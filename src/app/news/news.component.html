  We are looking for researchers who are interested in conducting a data collection study by <i>diaries</i> or <i>experience sampling (EMA)</i> using the OmniTrack platform. We are working on a research platform by extending OmniTrack to be used by researchers for conducting data collection studies. As a first step of this, we are designing the researchers' interface which supports diary study.
