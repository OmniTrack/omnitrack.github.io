<h2>OmniTrack Roadmap</h2>
<h3>2017 December - Open Source with a Standalone Server</h3>
<p>
  We are currently working on reimplementing the OmniTrack backend server from scratch, by removing dependency on Google Firebase.
  We will open the source code of the OmniTrack Android, and associated server running on Node.js to allow researchers manage the tracker data in their own server storage.

<h2>Call for Researchers</h2>
<p>
  We are looking for researchers who are interested in conducting a data collection study by <i>diaries</i> or <i>experience sampling (EMA)</i> using the OmniTrack platform. We are working on a research platform by extending OmniTrack to be used by researchers for conducting data collection studies. As a first step of this, we are designing the researchers' interface which supports diary study.
</p>
<div class="paragraph">
  The example diary studies we envision follows:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Self-report diaries which are personalized for each participant
    </li>
    <li>
      Self-reports + passively gathered fitness device data
    </li>
    <li>
      Data collection involving multiple sensing devices
    </li>
  </ol>

  If you are interested in such types of studies and have any inquiries, feel free to contact us!

<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p class="small">
  Currently, OmniTrack for Android heavily depends on Google Play Services, including <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/">GCM</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>.
  This implies that OmniTrack CANNOT be targeted for the citizens in the countries <b>which are restricting the access to the Google services</b> (China is one prominent region for such restrictions).
  <br>
  Please take this into account when you plan your deployment target audience.
